# SocialMail a0.1

An experimental social networking app, without the network.

# Project Description and Goals

On it's face, SocialMail is a social networking client, with the ability to make posts, an infinite scrolling wall of posts from other users, the ability to reply and carry on conversations with other people in your network. While the project is currently in a pre-release state, the end goal is to emulate all the main features of popular social media sites.

However, SocialMail does not use a centralized server. It doesn't use it's own 'decentralized' server, either. SocialMail does not collect any data at all. It doesn't have any advertising. It doesn't have any algorythims deciding what you should or shouldn't see. The only person who can censor the content you see, is you. All you need is an email account, where sent and recieved messages are stored, and SocialMail handles the rest entirely on your device.

Yes, SocialMail uses a standard email account to give you the full social networking experience. The beauty in this design, is that no one else in your contact list needs to use SocialMail. Any message you send to  a non-user will be just a standard email for them, to read and respond to as normal. There is no need to convince anyone to join a new network, or leave their old one, because everyone has an email address. No more: 'but all my friends use X network,' never again: 'I used it for a while, but no one else was.' SocialMail replaces YOUR social networking experience, but doesn't require anyone else to.

SocialMail features a Groups-like feature called "Contact Books". You can create as many as you'd like, and store as many contacts in each Book as you'd like. This gives you a quick and easy, one-touch method of Posting messages to only "Family," or only "Friends," availible right beside the post field. This information is all stored locally on your device. One touch sharing of your Contact Books between devices is planned.

Privacy and User Protection is one of the main goals of SocialMail. Your app will never share any of your contacts with a third party. When Posting a message to one of your Contact Books, none of the recievers will have any information about who else it was sent to. They will only be able to reply to your message directly. When you receive a reply, it will be entirely up to you to propegate that message forward. But don't worry, this will all be handled in a slick, and easy to use interface that's more like a facebook conversation than a re:re:re:re:re email chain.

# ALPHA MEANS UNFINISHED AND UNSTABLE

This is still a very early project, only just born and full of bugs, lacking many of it's core features. It is absolutely NOT recomended to use in it's alpha state, beyond testing purposes.
